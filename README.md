# Budworm Forest Model - Analysis Of Forest Parameters



This projct is based on the paper Ludwig et al. 1978. We consider the Budworm forest model to simulate the impact of a spruce Budworm outbreak
 on the balsam fir tree forests. This model is a general model and can be applied for any parasite 
attack on a forest. The forest dynamics depend on a number of parameters like the growth rate 
of foliage, the Budworm population, the energy reserves available to the forest, etc. The Budworm
population is a fast variable (with respect to time).
 This project focuses on slow variables (with respect to time) which are related to the health of the forest assuming
the fast variables have reached their respective equilibrium states. We are interested in figuring out
 how do slow variables behave given the values of fast variables and how the bifurcations occur
on changing the fast variables. Additionally, some more insights into the problem were found which were
not directly described in the paper. Wherever possible an effort was made to get biological insights from
the mathematical results obtained.
